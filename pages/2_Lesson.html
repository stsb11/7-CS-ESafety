<h3 id="sec-3-1">Learn it</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read through these behaviours and click on the links and watch the videos.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Using mobile phones in classrooms</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In many schools using mobile phones is against school rules, at least during lessons. 
</li>
<li>However, at BGS, you may have had good experience of using your mobile phone in Systems and Control to help with instructions. 
</li>
<li>The item is not bad <i>per se</i> it is what you do with it. Use it wisely.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Visiting unknown websites included in emails from people you don’t know</b>
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/dodgylink.png" alt="dodgylink.png" />
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are too many  unknown factors in this above email. Both the sender of the email and the link in the email are unknown. 
</li>
<li>Viruses can be downloaded, without your knowledge, from websites. Using up-to-date anti virus software will help keep your computer as safe as possible but don't click on anything you are not sure about. 
</li>
<li>If in doubt ask an adult or <i>www.childnet.com/sorted</i> for more information.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Forwarding on nasty texts about other pupils</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why are you forwarding it? Is it to report what is going on? That's what a good citizen would do. 
</li>
<li>Clearly passing it on to make the matter worse is not the correct thing. Think before you act. Once it is done&#x2026; it is done. 
</li>
<li>This is a form of bullying called cyberbullying. It is not 'banter' or harmless - <b>it is a crime</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Forwarding on chain emails</b>
</p>

<p>
-What is a chain letter/email? A chain emails is a message sent to someone asking them to pass on a message to as many people as possible. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They are often hoaxes or urban legends. Harmless fun or a nuisance? The best policy&#x2026; break the chain and delete them upon receipt.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Letting your mates know about a site that helps with history coursework</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A great use of technology and as we all know sharing is caring! However, is everything on the World Wide Web true? 
</li>
<li>Check out this <a href="http://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/">site</a>. What do you think?  
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Uploading photos of your mates on to a social network</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Photos are often a large part of young people’s online experiences and many of you are happy for your images to be posted online. You have heard that there are photos that have been posted about you that they are unhappy about. Do you know how to solve this? 
</li>
<li>Many social networks make available reporting <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/help/1381617785483471?helpref=search&sr=2&query=posted%2520my%2520image%2520without%2520my%2520permission">facilities</a> for abusive photos – make sure you know how to do it and do report if something is not right.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Always accepting anyone who asks to be your buddy on instant messenger or a social network e.g. Myspace/Facebook</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is incredibly important that you spend time reflecting on who you would accept into your online life. Not everyone is who they appear to be&#x2026; 
</li>
</ul>
<b>Humorous approach</b>

<b>Scare tactics</b>

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jMhMVEjEQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
<b>Ignoring messages from your anti virus software saying that updates are available or out of date</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An important aspect of internet security is keeping up with updates to ensure the best protection for computers. 
</li>
<li>Why? - check out this <a href="http://www.computerhowtoguide.com/2012/05/why-update-antivirus-software-frequently.html">site</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Having online discussions, with someone you don’t know, about private things</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The internet can be an environment where users feel anonymous and they can become involved in conversations of a private matter with people they have never met. 
</li>
<li>This can be a positive thing in terms of online counselling services such as <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/get-support/1-2-1-counsellor-chat/">Childline</a>. However, some people engage children and young people in private discussions through flattery, persuasion and manipulation. 
</li>
<li>You need to be aware of this and make sure that your private discussions are done with trustworthy, qualified people. 
</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you are ever worried, uncomfortable or upset about something online then the key thing to do is to seek help and tell someone. This maybe a trusted adult or friend. 
</li>
<li>However there are other ways in which you may choose to seek help with online issues.
</li>
<li>This includes ways you can challenge unacceptable behaviour online.
